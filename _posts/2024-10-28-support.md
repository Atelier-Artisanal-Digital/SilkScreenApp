Welcome to the **SilkScreen** support page! We’re here to help you get the most out of our app. Below, you’ll find useful information and resources to assist you.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I use SilkScreen?
**SilkScreen** is an intuitive app that allows you to design dynamic, colorful visuals. Check out the in-app tutorials or our [User Guide](#) for detailed instructions on using different features.

### How can I report a bug or request a feature?
If you encounter any issues or have a suggestion, please send an email to _[Your Contact Email]_. Include as much information as possible so we can resolve the issue quickly.

### How do in-app purchases work?
**SilkScreen** offers non-consumable in-app purchases as a way for users to show their appreciation and support our development. These purchases are like a “Buy me a coffee” gesture, offering three tipping options to give users a choice of what feels right for them. All contributions help us continue to improve the app and build new features. These in-app purchases do not unlock additional features within the app.
