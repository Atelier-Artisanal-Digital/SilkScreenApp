**Effective Date:** January 24, 2025

Atelier Artisanal Digital ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through this Privacy Policy. This document outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use the SilkScreen app ("the App").

### Information We Collect

#### 1. Account Information

- **Sign in with Apple:** If you choose to create an account, we collect information provided by Apple, including a unique identifier and your email address. This account allows you to link purchases to your account and access them on other devices.

#### 2. In-App Purchases

- **RevenueCat:** We use RevenueCat to manage in-app purchases. RevenueCat collects information about your purchases but does not link this data to your identity. No tracking is performed. For more information you can check their [Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy).

#### 3. Usage Analytics

- **TelemetryDeck:** We use TelemetryDeck to collect anonymized usage data to improve the App’s functionality. No data collected by TelemetryDeck is linked to your identity, and no tracking is performed. For more information you can check their [Privacy FAQ](https://telemetrydeck.com/docs/guides/privacy-faq/).

#### 4. Automatically Collected Data

- The App may collect technical information, such as device type, operating system, and app version, to ensure compatibility and provide an optimized experience. This data is collected anonymously.

---

### How We Use Your Information

We use the information collected to:

- Provide, operate, and maintain the App.
- Manage in-app purchases and account linking.
- Improve the App’s features and performance.
- Address technical issues and provide support.

---

### Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes. We share data only in the following circumstances:

- **RevenueCat:** To process in-app purchases.
- **TelemetryDeck:** To collect anonymized usage analytics.
- **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your information to comply with legal obligations or protect our rights.

---

### Data Security

We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The app itself does not store any user information. Instead, it relies on trusted third-party services: RevenueCat for managing purchases and TelemetryDeck for collecting anonymized usage data. Account information is stored locally on your device in the Keychain, adhering to Apple’s privacy and security best practices. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

---

### Data Retention

We retain information as long as necessary to provide the App’s services and fulfill legal obligations. Account information can be deleted upon user request by contacting support.

---

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Updates will be effective immediately upon posting within the App or on our website.
