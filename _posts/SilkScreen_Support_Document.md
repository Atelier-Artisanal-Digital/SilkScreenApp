### 1. Getting Started

#### What is SilkScreen?

SilkScreen invites you on a creative journey to transform your screen into a captivating, dynamic canvas. Imagine starting with a simple grid and bringing it to life by customizing every element. You can refine the grid’s resolution to add complexity, select vibrant color palettes to set the mood, and animate both shapes and colors to create flowing patterns that move and shift seamlessly.

As you explore, you’ll discover intuitive controls that allow you to adjust animations in real-time, dragging and reshaping grid points to sculpt intricate, living artwork. Whether you prefer smooth waves or random, fast-paced motion styles, SilkScreen provides the tools to craft something uniquely yours.

Once your masterpiece is complete, save your creation as a high-quality image or video, perfect for sharing or using as a wallpaper. Creating an account isn’t required, but doing so enables you to link subscriptions across all your devices, unlocking the full potential of SilkScreen.
