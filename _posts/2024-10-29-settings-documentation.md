## Customize Shape
### Horizontal Resolution
Adjust the number of horizontal divisions in your visual. Higher values create more detail, allowing for intricate designs.

### Vertical Resolution
Adjust the number of vertical divisions. Increasing this value adds complexity to your designâ€™s grid.

### Frame Effect
Toggle between having a uniform grid or a tighter inner grid with a visible border effect.

## Anchor Movement
### Movement Style
Choose how the anchors move across the screen:
- **Wave Motion**: Smooth, oscillating movement like gentle waves.
- **Random Drift**: Organic, unpredictable motion inspired by natural randomness.

### Animated Areas
Select which parts of your visual will be animated. Focus movement on specific anchors for targeted effects.

### Sync Movement
Toggle between synchronized motion or allowing each anchor to move independently for a more dynamic effect.

## Color Customization
### Color Palette
Choose a set of colors for your visual:
- **Vibrant Mix**: Random colors for a lively display.
- **Shaded Hue**: Variations of a single color for a unified look.
- **Monochrome**: Classic black-and-white visuals.

### Primary Tint
Select the main color to use when the **Shaded Hue** palette is active. All shades will be variations of this color.

### Background Color
Set a background color that will be visible behind the mesh during animation.

## Color Transition
### Type
Select how colors change over time:
- **Color Cycle**: Smoothly rotates colors in a continuous loop.
- **Smooth Shift**: Gradual color transitions for a flowing effect.
- **Rapid Shuffle**: Quick, random changes for an energetic display.

### Amplitude
Control the intensity of color variation during animations. Larger values result in more dramatic changes.

### Speed
Adjust how quickly the color transitions occur. Lower speeds create a calming effect, while higher speeds offer a more dynamic feel.
